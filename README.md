# KJG-bilayer-project
This contains scripts and sets of functions used to calculate Majorana mean fields for the Kitaev Heisenberg Gamma bilayer model. 
The julia file meanfieldcalc.jl contains functions to treat the model with anisotropic couplings. 
The julia file Bilayer_isotropic_meanfieldcalc.jl contains functions which have been optimised to treat the case of disordered spins and isotropic coupling constants.
